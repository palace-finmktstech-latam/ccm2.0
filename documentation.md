- **New System**: Firebase Authentication with emulator for development
- **Integration Point**: `frontend/src/components/auth/AuthContext.tsx`

**Firebase SDK Integration:**
- **Configuration**: `frontend/src/config/firebase.ts` created
- **Emulator Connections**: Auth (port 9099) and Firestore (port 8080)
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic emulator connection in development mode
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly Firebase Auth error messages

**User Role Management:**
- **Email-Based Role Assignment**: Automatic role detection from email domains
  - `@bancoabc.cl` ‚Üí Bank Admin
  - `admin@xyz.cl` ‚Üí Client Admin  
  - Other emails ‚Üí Client User
- **Real-Time State**: `onAuthStateChanged` listener for session management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with Firebase Auth types

**Demo User Environment:**
- **Test Users**: Created in Firebase Auth emulator
- **Credentials**: All users use `demo123` password for demo consistency
- **Role Testing**: Each user type tested for proper navigation and permissions

### Technical Implementation Details

**Authentication Flow:**
1. **Login**: `signInWithEmailAndPassword` with Firebase Auth
2. **State Management**: Real-time user state via `onAuthStateChanged`
3. **Role Mapping**: Automatic role assignment based on email domain
4. **Session Persistence**: Firebase handles session across page refreshes
5. **Logout**: Clean session termination with `signOut`

**Development Environment Benefits:**
- **Offline Development**: No internet required for authentication testing
- **Fast User Creation**: Instant test user creation via emulator UI
- **Real Firebase Experience**: Identical API to production Firebase Auth
- **Easy Debugging**: Web UI for monitoring authentication events

**Production Transition Ready:**
- **Configuration Change**: Single line change to switch to production Firebase
- **User Migration**: Demo users can be recreated in production with real emails
- **Code Unchanged**: All authentication logic works identically in production

### Integration Quality Metrics

**Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ **Login Flow**: All three user types authenticate successfully
- ‚úÖ **Role-Based Navigation**: Proper page access based on user roles
- ‚úÖ **Session Management**: User sessions persist across browser refresh
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Appropriate error messages for invalid credentials
- ‚úÖ **Logout Functionality**: Clean session termination and state reset
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Compliance**: Zero compilation errors with Firebase integration

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Authentication Speed**: Immediate response from local emulator
- **Bundle Size Impact**: Firebase SDK adds ~150KB to bundle (acceptable)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal memory footprint with proper state management
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network and authentication errors

### Next Development Priorities

**Immediate Opportunities:**
1. **Backend API Integration**: Connect authenticated users to Firestore data
2. **User Profile Management**: Extend user data beyond basic auth information
3. **Permission Granularity**: Implement fine-grained permissions within roles
4. **Audit Logging**: Track user actions for security and compliance
5. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA support for enhanced security

**Database Integration Ready:**
The authentication system now provides the foundation for:
- **User-Scoped Data Access**: Firestore queries filtered by authenticated user
- **Role-Based Security Rules**: Firestore rules can use Firebase Auth tokens
- **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation**: User organization ID from auth context
- **Audit Trail Integration**: User identification for all data modifications
