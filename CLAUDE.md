# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## How you should work with this project
1. **Ensure CLAUDE.md, implementation-guide.md, todo.md and documentation.md exist**
    Ensure that you have the CLAUDE.md file, the implementation-guide.md file, the todo.md file and the documentation.md files created. If not, you will create these files in the root of this project. Make sure to keep a log of the tasks to do and tasks done in the todo.md. Make sure to update documentation.md once major changes have been applied to the codebase.
2. **business-specs.md provides context and guidance**
    Use this to locate yourself within the context of the business goals we wish to achieve.
3. **The implementation-guide.md explains how to implement the specs**
    This document translates the business specs into the technical approach. Use this as your guide.
3. **Assess and Outline**
    Begin by fully understanding the prompt, skim the relevant code files, and sketch out your approach in 'todo.md'
4. **Break it Down**
    Turn that sketch into a clear checklist of actionable items. You can tick each one off as you finish it.
5. **Plan Approval**
    Pause before any coding: share your checklist with me for a quick review and green light.
6. **Execute and Track**
    Work through each checklist item in order, updating its status to 'done' the moment it's complete.
7. **Keep me in the loop**
    After every major change, drop a brief note explaining what you did and why - just the high-level gist.
8. **Favour minimalism**
    Make each code tweak as small and targetted as possible. Lean changes minimise unexpected side-effects.
9. **Reflect and report**
    When you're all wrapped up, add a new section to 'documentation.md' summarising your edits, lessons learned and any next steps. This file will grow as the application grows.
