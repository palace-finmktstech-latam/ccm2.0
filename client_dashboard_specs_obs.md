OBSERVATION 1:

You've written the following in the document:

- **Service Projects**: Deploy to `prod1-service` (Santiago) and `nonprod1-service`
- **Shared VPC**: Leverage existing `vpc-prod-shared` network architecture

I'm concerned that this is talking about deploying to prod and non-prod services. I think we've already established that we have development services. Do you agree?

OBSERVATION 2:

Again you are talking about deploying to production. Please review this because here we should be deploying to development first of all. We can bear in mind production for future CI/CD requirements, but our first step is to get this working in development:

Deploy to established `palace.cl` organization infrastructure, utilizing the multi-region Shared VPC architecture.

### Production Deployment (Santiago Region)
```yaml
# Cloud Run service deployment to prod1-service project
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ccm-backend
  namespace: prod1-service
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        run.googleapis.com/vpc-access-connector: projects/vpc-host-prod/locations/southamerica-west1/connectors/vpc-connector
        run.googleapis.com/vpc-access-egress: private-ranges-only
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/prod1-service/ccm-backend
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID
          value: prod1-service
        - name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: anthropic-secrets
              key: api-key
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "1000m"
```


OBSERVATION 3:

Here it is also making reference to production:

**Frontend Deployment (Firebase Hosting)**
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "site": "ccm-frontend-prod",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [{
      "source": "**",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }],
    "headers": [{
      "source": "**/*.@(js|css)",
      "headers": [{
        "key": "Cache-Control",
        "value": "max-age=31536000"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```


OBSERVATION 4:

And here too:

## Security Implementation

**Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)**
Leverage existing KMS Autokey setup for all data at rest:

```python
# backend/config/firestore.py
from google.cloud import firestore
import os

def get_firestore_client():
    # Use CMEK from existing KMS Autokey setup
    project_id = os.getenv('PROJECT_ID', 'prod1-service')
    
    # Firestore automatically uses CMEK when configured at project level
    return firestore.Client(project=project_id)
```

OBSERVATION 5:

Note that you have the following prompt for the LLM:

prompt = f"""
        Tell me if this email is requesting the confirmation of a trade(s) or not.
        
        If there is a reference to a trade confirmation, set the Confirmation field to Yes.
        
        Extract the following fields:
        - Trade number (usually in subject line)
        - Trade date (dd-mm-yyyy format)
        - Currency (3-letter ISO code)
        - Amount (numeric value)
        - Counterparty name (bank name, not person)
        - Product type (map to: Spot, Forward, Swap, NDF, Option)
        
        Email content: {anonymized_content}
        
        Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
        {{
            "Confirmation": "Yes/No",
            "TradeNumber": "extracted_number",
            "TradeDate": "dd-mm-yyyy", 
            "Currency": "XXX",
            "Amount": numeric_value,
            "Counterparty": "bank_name",
            "ProductType": "mapped_product_type"
        }}
        """

Please note that the return JSON is extremely short compared with the original text. This is missing a lot of fields. If you need me to go back and get them, then I can do that for you.

OBSERVATION 6:

I do want to do something like this in the future. Please remove it for now or leave it as a placeholder. We can work on this later. I don't need to do it right now:

**Data Anonymization for LLM Processing**
```python
class DataAnonymizationService:
    def anonymize_for_llm(self, email_content: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Remove sensitive data before sending to Anthropic"""
        anonymized = email_content.copy()
        
        # Replace specific client names with generic terms
        anonymized['body'] = re.sub(
            r'\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b',  # Person names
            '[CLIENT_NAME]',
            anonymized['body']
        )
        
        # Replace specific amounts with rounded values
        anonymized['body'] = re.sub(
            r'\b\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.\d{2}\b',  # Precise amounts
            '[AMOUNT]',
            anonymized['body']
        )
        
        return anonymized
```

OBSERVATION 7:

Get rid of this part, we really don't need it because there is no real client data currently:

**Data Migration from v1.0**
```typescript
// Migration service for existing v1.0 users
class V1MigrationService {
  async migrateJsonToFirestore(organizationId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Load v1.0 JSON files
    const unmatchedTrades = await this.loadV1JsonFile('unmatched_trades.json');
    const matchedTrades = await this.loadV1JsonFile('matched_trades.json');
    const emailMatches = await this.loadV1JsonFile('email_matches.json');
    
    // Transform and save to Firestore with organization isolation
    await this.firestoreService.batchCreate(`organizations/${organizationId}/trades`, unmatchedTrades);
    await this.firestoreService.batchCreate(`organizations/${organizationId}/matches`, matchedTrades);
    await this.firestoreService.batchCreate(`organizations/${organizationId}/emails`, emailMatches);
  }
}
```

OBSERVATION 8:

In the description of version 1.0, I provided all the data structures for the three grids as you can see below. We need to incorporate this into the new version of these specs. You haven't done that at all. It is important that they are there in that document:
