## üéØ **Current Priority**

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Backend API Development** - Build FastAPI backend with Firestore integration
2. **Data Layer Implementation** - Replace mock data with real database operations
3. **Security Rules** - Deploy multi-tenant access controls
4. **Demo Data** - Create realistic test data for client presentations

## üìä **Progress Summary**

- **Phase 1 (Frontend)**: ‚úÖ **100% Complete**
- **Phase 1.5 (Authentication)**: ‚úÖ **100% Complete** 
- **Phase 2 (Backend)**: üîÑ **10% Complete** (planning and architecture)
- **Phase 3 (Data Integration)**: ‚è≥ **0% Complete** (waiting for backend)
- **Phase 4 (Production)**: ‚è≥ **0% Complete** (waiting for CMEK approval)

## üìù **Notes**

### **Current Status (August 4, 2025)**
- **Development Environment**: Fully operational with Firebase emulators
- **Authentication**: Real Firebase Auth integrated and tested
- **Frontend**: Complete professional UI with internationalization
- **Backend**: Architecture planned, ready for implementation
- **Database**: Emulator ready, production pending CMEK approval

### **Key Achievements**
- Successfully transitioned from mock to real Firebase authentication
- Maintained all existing functionality during Firebase integration
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors with Firebase SDK
- All three user roles (client admin, client user, bank admin) tested and working
- Professional UI/UX maintained throughout integration process

### **Technical Debt**
- Some frontend components still use mock data (will be replaced in Phase 3)
- Production Firebase configuration not yet implemented
- Security rules need production-level testing
- Performance optimization needed for production deployment
