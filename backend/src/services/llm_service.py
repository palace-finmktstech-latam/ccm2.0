                Tell me if this email is requesting the confirmation of a trade(s) or not. It could feasibly be about something else.

                {formatted_data}

                If there is a reference to a trade confirmation, set the Confirmation field to Yes.
                If there is no reference to a trade confirmation, set the Confirmation field to No.

                The most likely type of emails that we will process are those that request the confirmation of a trade, and they come from banks.
                
                Typically (but not always), the subject line of an email about a trade confirmation will include the words "ConfirmaciÃ³n" or "Confirmation" and the body will also probably refer to a confirmation.

                If this email is indeed about a trade confirmation, you need to extract the data as per the following instructions:
                
                Look for the trade number in the subject of the email and in the body. This is usually a number, e.g. "1234567890"). Can also be named as a reference and is one of the most important fields. It will always be present on a confirmation email.

                I also need you to extract some data from the email body. Data in the email body should also override data in the email subject, as it is possible that the conversation
                has moved on from the initial subject line.

                Remember that this email is written from the Bank's perspective, not you, the Client's. Therefore, the details of the trade are reversed. Specific consequences of this can include the following:
                - Counterparty: the bank could refer to you as the counterparty. However, from your perspective, the bank is the counterparty.
                - Currency 1: the bank could refer to the currency you pay as Currency 1. However, from your perspective, the currency you pay is Currency 2.
                - Currency 2: the bank could refer to the currency you receive as Currency 2. However, from your perspective, the currency you receive is Currency 1.
                - Direction: the bank could refer to the direction of the trade as "Buy" or "Sell". However, from your perspective, the direction of the trade is the opposite.
                - Counterparty Payment Method: the bank will refer to the payment method they use as "Forma de Pago Nuestra" or something similar. This should be saved in the field "Counterparty Payment Method".
                - Our Payment Method: the bank will refer to the payment method you use as "Forma de Pago Contraparte" or something similar. This should be saved in the field "Our Payment Method".
                
                The specific data you need to find is as follows:
                 
                - Trade Number, a number indicating the ID of the trade, can also be named as a reference. This is usually a number, e.g. "1234567890").
                - Counterparty ID, typically the bank's ID. It may not be present in the email, in which case you should leave it blank.
                - Counterparty Name, the bank's name
                - Product Type, if this says "Spot", save as "Spot". If it says "Seguro de Cambio", "Seguro de InflaciÃ³n", "Arbitraje", "Forward", "NDF", save as "Forward".
                - Direction, from your perspective as the client, are you buying from the bank or selling to the bank? Save as "Buy" or "Sell".
                - Currency 1, an ISO 4217 currency code, the currency you are buying or selling according to the Direction field. Remember if the bank says "Buy", you are selling to the bank (and you should store it as "Sell"), and if the bank says "Sell", you are buying from the bank (and you should store it as "Buy").
                - Amount of Currency 1, a number, the amount of currency 1 you are buying or selling according to the Direction field.
                - Currency 2, an ISO 4217 currency code, the other currency of the trade.
                - Settlement Type, if it says "CompensaciÃ³n" or "Non-Deliverable", save as "CompensaciÃ³n". If it says "Entrega FÃ­sica" or "Deliverable", save as "Entrega FÃ­sica".
                - Settlement Currency, an ISO 4217 currency code. If the Settlement Type is "Entrega FÃ­sica", this field is unlikely to exist or have a value, in which case set as "N/A".
                - Trade Date, a date, which can be in different formats
                - Value Date, a date, which can be in different formats
                - Maturity Date, a date, which can be in different formats
                - Payment Date, a date, which can be in different formats
                - Duration, an integer number, indicating the number of days between the value date and the maturity date
                - Forward Price, a number usually with decimal places
                - Fixing Reference, If you see anything such as "USD Obs", "Dolar Observado", "CLP10", "DÃ³lar Observado", "CLP Obs", save as "USD Obs".
                - Counterparty Payment Method, look in fields labelled "Forma de Pago". Usually one of the following values: "Trans Alto Valor", "ComBanc", "SWIFT", "Cuenta Corriente".
                - Our Payment Method, look in fields labelled "Forma de Pago". Usually one of the following values: "Trans Alto Valor", "ComBanc", "SWIFT", "Cuenta Corriente"

                Return this in a JSON format, but do not include any markdown formatting such as ```json or ```. This causes errors so I really need you to return it without any markdown formatting.
                DO NOT return any other text than the JSON, as this causes errors.

                The required structured of the JSON file is as follows:

                Now STOP for a minute, before you return the JSON. I need you to compare the data you have extracted into the Trades array in the JSON with the data in the email. If there is any difference on a specific field, overwrite the data in the JSON with the data you think is correct in the email.
                
                I repeat, the email body is the best source of truth.

                If the Direction field is "Buy", then QuantityCurrency1 is the amount of currency 1 you are buying from the bank. If the Direction field is "Sell", then QuantityCurrency1 is the amount of currency 1 you are selling to the bank.

                DO NOT return any other text than the JSON, as this causes errors. NO MARKDOWN.
